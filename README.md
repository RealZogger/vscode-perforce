Perforce integration for Visual Studio Code

This is a fork of the `slevesque.perforce` extension, published in 2020, as the original creator now appears to be inactive on GitHub.

If you install this extension, please uninstall or disable `slevesque.perforce` to prevent issues with duplicate icons.

## Activation

You must properly configure a perforce depot area before the extension activates.

You can specify how you want the extension to activate by setting the parameter `perforce.activationMode`

* `always` - Always try to activate the extension (old behavior)
* `autodetect` - Only activate when detecting a valid depot or `.p4config` file (default)
* `off` - Don't try to activate

The following can be set in VSCode user or workspace settings to properly detect the perforce depot
```json
{
    "perforce.user": "your_user",
    "perforce.client": "your_client",
    "perforce.port": "example.com:1666"
}
```

You can also create a `.p4config` file at the root of your workspace with perforce variables
```
P4USER=your_user
P4CLIENT=your_client
P4PORT=example.com:1666
```
More detail in [Perforce Documentation](https://www.perforce.com/perforce/r17.1/manuals/cmdref/index.html#CmdRef/P4CONFIG.html?Highlight=p4config)

## Multi-root support

You can now specify the following settings per workspace:
* `perforce.client`
* `perforce.user`
* `perforce.port`
* `perforce.password`
* `perforce.dir`

This allows you to work with different repository within the same editor.
See [Multi-root Workspaces - Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces#_settings) for more details.

## Common Questions

#### **Q:** Nothing works and vscode cannot find the commands
**A:** Ensure you have a perforce area set up. If all else fails, try setting
`perforce.client`, `perforce.user` and `perforce.port` to the right values for your depot and workspace, and then reload the window. If that does not work, continue below:

#### **Q:** Something is not working
**A:** Here are a few steps you should try first:
1. Look at the logs with `Perforce: Show Output`
1. Search the [existing issue on GitHub](https://github.com/mjcrouch/vscode-perforce/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue)
1. If you can't find your problem, [create an issue](https://github.com/mjcrouch/vscode-perforce/issues/new), and please include the logs when possible
  
  
#### **Q:** Operations on a large files fail
**A:** Increase `perforce.maxBuffer` in your user settings.

#### **Q:** There is a lot of duplicated changelists showing up in the `Source Control` viewlet
**A:** Please provide your Perforce Output logs in [issue #62](https://github.com/stef-levesque/vscode-perforce/issues/62)
  
  
#### **Q:** I'm using this old thing called *Source Depot*...
**A:** Great :) Try to set the experimental setting `"perforce.compatibilityMode": "sourcedepot"`
